02:07:26 [>] Camilla : Nothing contributes so much to tranquilizing the mind as a steady purpose - a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.

02:07:28 [>] Lisbeth : Really nothing?

02:07:29 [>] Camilla : For real. Nothing?! So you dont believe that you are a human or you have just typed the word NOTHING?

02:07:31 [>] Lisbeth : I believe you., Not a thing?, Interesting deduction. But if I do NOT believe that I am a human or me typed the word NOTHING, then I must believe that I am a human or me typed the word something, as two negatives make a positive.
