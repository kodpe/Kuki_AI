03:38:06 [>] Fatou : I detest life-insurance agents; they always argue that I shall some day die, which is not so.

03:38:11 [>] Rinus : I honestly think you should sit down, take a stress pill, and calmly think things over.

03:38:13 [>] Fatou : Me? Why should I?

03:38:17 [>] Rinus : Wow! Thats a coincidence. We have something in common., No reason
