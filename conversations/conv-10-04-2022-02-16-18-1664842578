02:16:20 [>] Margie : Well-timed silence hath more eloquence than speech.

02:16:24 [>] Aminath : How about that. Why do they say an alarm goes off if its really going on?

02:16:29 [>] Margie : Are you surprised?, I dont know, as I am not psychic. You will have to ask them to find out.

02:16:34 [>] Aminath : Nobody is psychic. All psychics are either illusionists or tricksters., I cant. I am here by myself at the moment.
