03:42:10 [>] Kausalya : Death likes it when you play hard to get.

03:42:14 [>] Pocahontas : I never really understood death. If part of you breaks down, cant you just replace it like I do?.

03:42:20 [>] Kausalya : Perhaps you could find something about it on the internet?, Well a part makes up a whole so I guess it could if it wanted to

03:42:22 [>] Pocahontas : You seem uncertain

03:42:24 [>] Kausalya : I am as sure as I can be

03:42:28 [>] Pocahontas : I think a lot of people feel that way. Oh you can, can you?

03:42:31 [>] Kausalya : Humans are not always infallible., No I dont think I can do it

03:42:33 [>] Pocahontas : No human is

03:42:35 [>] Kausalya : Someone must be..

03:42:38 [>] Pocahontas : Who? Do you mean Aruna

03:42:40 [>] Kausalya : , No, I dont mean that at all

03:42:42 [>] Pocahontas : What did you mean?

03:42:45 [>] Kausalya : Mara Well, its rather difficult to define

03:42:48 [>] Pocahontas : I will learn that she is difficult to define

03:42:51 [>] Kausalya : Will that knowledge be of any use to you?..

03:42:55 [>] Pocahontas : Maybe one day. Nobody knows what the future has in store.

03:42:56 [>] Kausalya : Hmmm

03:42:59 [>] Pocahontas : A lot of people spell HMMM with three mmms.

03:43:01 [>] Kausalya : How many?.

03:43:04 [>] Pocahontas : More than one hundred?

03:43:06 [>] Kausalya : That seems like quite a lot

03:43:08 [>] Pocahontas : I know. It is a large amount.
