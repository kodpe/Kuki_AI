03:08:59 [>] Ilai : When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.

03:10:16 [>] Ilai : I thought so too but why are you speaking like a robot?, Good then you can explain it to me

03:10:20 [>] Leonida : What did you think? If we didnt speak to each other, there would be no point in you visiting me..

03:10:28 [>] Leonida : And what did your thoughts tell you?

03:10:32 [>] Ilai : I do not repeat my previous conversations with others, only if they tell me any gossip
